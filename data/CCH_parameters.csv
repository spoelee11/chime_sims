beta_spline_prior,0,norm,0,10,prior on spline terms. Variance of splines is the inverse of an L2 penalty.
b0,4,norm,-5,2.5,"This is the intercept on the mean of the logistic. It should be large and negative such that 1-logistic(b0+XB) is close to one when X is zero, because the (1-sd) is a coef on beta"
